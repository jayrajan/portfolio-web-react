[Refer For tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8Dg0KVnfMA)

[Refer TanStack Page](https://tanstack.com/query/v3/docs/react/overview)

## Why we use React-query?

to manage asynchronous state (api calls) more easily and efficiently.

### Install react-query and dev-tools in your project

```
npm i @tanstack/react-query
npm i @tanstack/react-query-devtools
```

### Query vs Mutation (Two main things)

Query is getting data from somewhere (for eg: get a list of post)
Mutation is changing some type of data.(for eg: create a new post)
